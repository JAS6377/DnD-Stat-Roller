# DnD-Stat-Roller

*****NOTE*****
Stat_Roller.py will still do the job, but is somewhat limited. It is hard coded to ONLY roll 6 stats. v2.0 will allow the user to specify the number of stats rolled. It still has the baked-in snarkiness just because I thought it was fun. Other than that, use v2.0.


Automated stat roller for D&amp;D. Rolls 5 stats with the option to drop the lowest roll if you roll 4 times. 

This is essentially just a training exercise to get myself up and running with Python and GitHub basics. 
I will not be maintaining this regularly.
